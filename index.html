                On this website you can see amazing artwork from the 21th century and early artworks.
                I believe that it is interesting to see waht artists made then and what we make now.
                What is the comparison? What is the difference?
                I  believe that early artwork can be a big inspiration for us.
                Feel free to read my thoughts and scroll to the amazing artworks.

        An optical poem produced by Oskar Fischinger 1938 is a film about geometric shapes. 
When the film starts you see a few spheres, the music starts slowly. 
When you keep watching, the shapes become more and more and move even faster.
The music changes in speed together with the shapes and even though the film includes
only music and geometric shapes you keep watching.
An optical poem is almsot working hypnotic</p>

<p>As a graphic designer we work a lot with geometric shapes.
    I believe that an optical poem an big inspiration bron is to graphic designers
    At least, the challenge to work with less elements and still make an inspirational 
    work is very interesting to me.

    <p>On the left you can scroll to several artworks related to these days.
        This is work based on artwork these days in comparison with older artwork.
        If you want to read my thoughts about it be free to discover more from this on my website.
        It is nice to see how a lot of artwork is related to artwork from the past.
