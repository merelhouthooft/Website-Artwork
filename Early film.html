        <h1>Motion in images</h1>

        <p>
            Involving motion in images is a great technique to make the image way more interesting.
            We have a lot of tools to capture the motion.
            For instance, if you have an iPhone you can make live photos. I use this all the time. 
            It is such a nice way to capture the moment, with not only the picture but a short video as well.
            It brings me a lot of memories and warm feelings to think back to that moment.

<h1>Early film</h1>

<p>
    Since motion pictures were invented, audiences have loved how they tell stories. 
    Movies enabled people to travel the world vicariously, and experience tragedy, love and nearly every other emotion. 
    Movies spread quickly, making them one of the most accessible and beloved forms of entertainment in the world.

    Photography became a part of public life in the mid-19th century, especially during the Civil War, when photographers documented American battlefields for the first time. 
    Experimenting with ways to exhibit photographs, several inventors came up with a simple toy that made it possible for a series of pictures to be viewed in rapid succession, creating the illusion of motion. 
    It was called a zoetrope.

<p>
    In October 19, 1878, Scientific American published a series of pictures depicting a horse in full gallop, along with instructions to view them through the zoetrope. 
    The photos were taken by an English photographer, Eadweard Muybridge, to settle a bet between California businessman Leland Stanford and his colleagues. 
    Stanford contended that at some point in a horse's stride, all four hooves were off the ground. 
    He enlisted Muybridge to take photographs of the positions of a horse's hooves in rapid succession. 
    Muybridge's 12 pictures showed that Stanford had won the bet.
