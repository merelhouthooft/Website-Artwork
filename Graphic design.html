        <h1>Vaudeville posters</h1>

        <p>
            Vaudeville was a fusion of centuries-old cultural traditions, 
            including the English Music Hall, minstrel shows of antebellum America, and Yiddish theater. 
            Though certainly not free from the prejudice of the times, 
            Vaudeville was the earliest entertainment form to cross racial and class boundaries.

            <p>
        
            For these Vaudeville shows they made posters as advertising. I think the posters do have a great design.
            It was a first step to practice graphic design on an commercial way.

<h1>Graphic design</h1>

<p>
    First, lets begin with defining what graphic design is. 
    The term “graphic design” is broad and is often used to categorize various disciplines of design 
    including digital and web design. 
    But traditional graphic design is referred to as print design like 
    posters, book covers, magazine layouts, advertisements, package design, as well as logo and branding.

<p>
    The industrial revolution, a period from about 1760 to 1840, introduced new technologies for increasing 
    the efficiency and production of manufacturing processes such as lithography.
    Lithography is a method of printing that involves inking your design into a stone or metal surface and transferring it to a sheet of paper. 
    Eventually, this led to chromolithography which is simply lithography but with color.

<p>
    Now you have a better idea of how graphic design began with the earliest form of visual and written communication. 
    Lets dive into some key influential art movements that helped evolved graphic design.
    You may notice how these art movements influence trends and how some of them even come back into style. 
    Its important to have a solid background in the history of design so you can understand where these trends come from and how to use them in your designs.
